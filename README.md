Hello,

- My name is Gustavo Assad Rocha @GAssadRocha. 
- I have a background in 🎓Mechanical and 🎓Electronics Engineering, but I love to code. 
- Coding is fun, challeging and useful all at the same time. Everyday I learn something new and become more in love. This profile is being used to save my projects and to show people my work.

To this day, those are the technologies I know. Will update it as time goes by:

- Python 🐍
- Django ⛓️
- HTML 
- Bootstrap
- C
- C++
- Arduino


💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. Any new opportunity is a chance to learn something new and meet new people.
